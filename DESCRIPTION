Description: This package provides an R-based interface for Pushover. In order to use it, you'll need to register for Pushover, and apply for a 'script' apikey at \href{https://pushover.net/api}{here}. If you'd like, you can create a JSON file called "pushoverinfo.json" in your home directory (or your default working directory on Windows). Otherwise you'll have to enter everything manually.
Depends:
    R (>= 3.1.1)
