Authors@R: "Nick Bloom <n.bloom@icloud.com> [aut, cre]"
Description: This package provides an R-based interface for Pushover. In order
    to use it, you'll need to register for Pushover, and apply for a 'script'
    apikey at https://pushover.net/api. If you'd like, you can
    create a JSON file called "pushoverinfo.json" in your home directory (or
    your default working directory on Windows). Otherwise you'll have to enter
    everything manually.
Depends:
    R (>= 3.1.1)
